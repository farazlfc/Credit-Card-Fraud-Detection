# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
•An Autoencoder Neural Network (implemented in Keras) was used in unsupervised (or semi-supervised) fashion for Anomaly  Detection in credit card transaction data.  •The trained model was evaluated on pre-labeled and anonymized dataset.  •Local Outlier Factor, One-Class Support Vector Machine and Isolation Forest methods were also applied and compared.
